    <h1>My name is Kevin and I love Panda's! They are my favorite Mammal! They are actually not bears but they are highly intelligent and have complex social interactions. Breeding panda's in captivity has proved a difficult objective to successfully achieve
        for zoos and wildlife breeding centers both in China and in other nations because of the relatively poor understood mating rituals of these complex and interesting beings.!</h1>

    <h2>Reasons I like Pandas</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>They have complex social interactions and erode the notion of animals being automatons that are not worthy of rights.</li>

        <li>They are cute</li>
        <li></li>

        <li>They are endangered and provide and excellent rallying cry for natural preservation of all species endangered</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
